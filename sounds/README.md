# Sound Files Directory

This directory contains notification sounds for ClaudeBell.

## Default Sounds

Since we cannot include actual WAV files in the initial repository, the scripts will fall back to system sounds. Users can add their own WAV files here:

- `default.wav` - Default notification sound
- `alert.wav` - Urgent attention required
- `success.wav` - Task completed successfully  
- `error.wav` - Error occurred
- `gentle-chime.wav` - Soft notification

## Adding Custom Sounds

1. Place any WAV file in this directory
2. Name it according to the sound types above
3. The scripts will automatically use your custom sounds
